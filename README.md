# Astro Essentials (WiSe 2022/2023): Problem Sets

This repository contains code I've used to compute several quantities required in the solutions of the problem sets.\
The problem sets where I've computed anything each have their own notebook.

## PDFs

In the `pdfs` folder, you may also find the pdfs of the solutions. Good luck!

**Disclaimer:** This collection is incomplete, and some notebooks might not really be up to higher coding standards.\
I hope they might be of some use anyways, good luck!
